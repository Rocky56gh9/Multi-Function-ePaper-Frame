# multimode-epaper-frame
A DIY project resulting in an e-paper display built into a picture frame that uses an API from Reddit to pull and display Dad Jokes and Shower Thoughts, an API from OpenWeather to display a weather station, and web scraping to display a daily horoscope. Also includes a sleep image for the display for overnight hours.
