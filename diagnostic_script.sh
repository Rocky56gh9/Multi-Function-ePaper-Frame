### Additional Diagnostic Script

Let's create an additional diagnostic script to help identify where the issue is occurring. This script will log the current environment and run some basic tests.

### diagnostic_script.sh

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Starting diagnostic_script.sh..."

# Log current environment
echo "Current directory: $(pwd)"
echo "Environment variables:"
printenv

# Check if run_all_configs.py exists
if [ ! -f ~/multimode-epaper-frame/run_all_configs.py ]; then
  echo "run_all_configs.py does not exist in ~/multimode-epaper-frame"
  exit 1
fi

echo "run_all_configs.py exists."

# Ensure run_all_configs.py is executable
chmod +x ~/multimode-epaper-frame/run_all_configs.py

# Change to the directory where run_all_configs.py is located
cd ~/multimode-epaper-frame || { echo "Failed to change directory to ~/multimode-epaper-frame. Exiting."; exit 1; }

# Output current directory to verify
echo "Current directory after cd: $(pwd)"
ls -l

# Run the script
echo "Running run_all_configs.py..."
python3 run_all_configs.py

# Check the exit status of run_all_configs.py
if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
  echo "run_all_configs.py encountered an error. Exiting."
  exit 1
fi

echo "run_all_configs.py executed successfully."
